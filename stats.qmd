# About
This notebook is for me to record my notes in learning statistics. It includes specific math formulas, examples and how to calculate them in Python. Some notes are directly copied from various different sources. 

# Probability

## Bayes' theorem

Posterior probability is the updated probability of an event based on new data. Posterior means occurring after. Posterior probability is calculated by updating the prior probability using Bayes' theorem. 

$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{ P(B \mid A) * P(A) }{ P(B) }$$

Event A = Rain
<br>
Event B = Cloudy

Now we are trying to get the probaility of A given event B. 
<br>
This means the probability of rain, given it's cloudy. 

This is also called posterior probability. 

$$P(Rain \mid Cloud) = \frac{ P(Cloud \mid Rain) * P(Rain) }{ P(Cloudy) }$$

Let's say below are the probability of each event: 

- Overall chance of rain = 10%
- All days start off cloudy = 40%
- Rainy days start of cloudy (P(Cloud|Rain)) = 50%

$$P(Rain \mid Cloud) = \frac{ 50\% * 10\% }{ 40\% }$$

```{python}
p_a_b = 0.5*0.1/0.4

print(p_a_b)
```

$$P(Rain \mid Cloud) = 12.5%$$

## Bayes' theorem - expaned version

Sometimes you don't know the probability of event B, which is in the denominator of the equation for the basic Bayes' theorem. In that case, you can use the expanded version of Bayes' theorem, because you don't need to know the probability of event B to use the expanded version. 

$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) * P(A)} {P(B \mid A) * P(A) + P(B \mid not A) * P(not A)}$$

Let's say we are conducting test for a medical condition. Below are the related probability: 

|Condition                   |Probability|Variable |
|----------------------------|-----------|---------|
|Having the medical condition|1%         |P(A)     |
|Test positive|unknown|P(B)|
|Given test is positive, has the medical condition|95%|P(B \| A)|
|Given test is positive, doesn't have the medical condition|2%|P(B \| not A)|
|Does not have the medical condition|99%|1-P(A)|

: Example: medical condition and test result

<br>

Now we are trying to find the probability of the person actually having the medical condition, given the test is positive. 

This would be P(A \| B). 

We cannot use the basic Bayes' theorem as the P(B) is unknown. This is when we need the expaned version. 

Putting all available variables into the formula will look like this: 
$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.95 \times 0.01}{(0.95 \times 0.01) + (0.02 \times 0.99)}
$$


```{python}
P_A_B = 0.95 * 0.01 / (0.95*0.01 + 0.02 * 0.99)
print(P_A_B)
```

$$P(A \mid B) = 32.4%$$
